# KeyValueDatabase Overview

1. **Base.cs**  
   Defines core operations such as `Insert`, `Get`, `Set`, and `Delete` for the key-value database. It provides a structure using generics for different types of keys and values, enabling extensibility and custom implementations.

2. **DataPosition.cs**  
   Manages the position of data in memory or on disk, abstracting the storage layer to ensure efficient retrieval and memory management.

3. **Delete.cs**  
   Handles data removal, updating internal structures to free memory and manage the positions of keys.

4. **Get.cs**  
   Retrieves values based on keys, checking if the key exists and fetching the corresponding value.

5. **Insert.cs**  
   Manages data insertion. If the key already exists, it updates the value; otherwise, it inserts a new key-value pair.

6. **Keys.cs**  
   Manages key operations like counting, searching, and indexing keys for efficient retrieval.

7. **Links.cs**  
   Manages internal links and references between data items, improving data access and structure management.

8. **RunTimeInfo.cs**  
   Stores runtime data for the database, such as performance metrics, current states, or configuration parameters.

9. **Set.cs**  
   Responsible for updating the stored values, ensuring that changes are properly reflected within the database.
