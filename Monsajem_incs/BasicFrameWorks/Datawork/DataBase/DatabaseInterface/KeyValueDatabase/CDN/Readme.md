## CDN-Based Record Synchronization Mechanism

This CDN-powered database structure delivers each record as an individual HTTP/HTTPS-accessible file, enabling fine-grained control over record-level updates and caching.

### How It Works

1. **Central Update Index**  
   A centralized file (UpdateCode Index) holds the latest update codes of all records. This file is lightweight and is always loaded first by the client.

2. **Change Detection**  
   The client compares its local version of update codes with the CDN version to determine which records have been updated or changed.

3. **Parallel Record Fetching via HTTP/HTTPS**  
   Once updated records are identified, the client instantly requests each required record file via standard CDN HTTP/HTTPS calls.  
   Modern HTTP clients (e.g., HTTP/2 or HTTP/3) can:
   - Open persistent connections with **Keep-Alive** enabled.
   - Send multiple requests **in parallel** over a single or multiple connections.
   - Stream responses efficiently with built-in CDN caching.

4. **Speed and Efficiency**  
   - Only changed records are fetched â€” there's no need to reload the entire database.
   - CDN servers distribute and cache content globally for faster access.
   - Concurrent downloads ensure minimal delay, even with a large number of updates.

### Benefits

- **Fast Initial Load**: Only a central index file is loaded initially.
- **Minimized Bandwidth**: Clients fetch only what they need.
- **Scalability**: Supports many simultaneous clients without stressing a central server.
- **HTTP/HTTPS Standardization**: Works across browsers and devices without custom protocols.

### Use Case Recommendation

This approach is ideal for:
- Web-based applications.
- Distributed systems with low-latency requirements.
- Scenarios where offline caching and partial updates are critical.
