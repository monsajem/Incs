# Monsajem Incs

A complete and modular framework for building all kinds of software applications â€” featuring a high-performance custom database, a custom communication protocol, and a modern Blazor-based UI layer.

This repository is organized into multiple components, each serving a specific purpose in the framework's ecosystem. From low-level data manipulation and serialization to full-stack UI, everything is built from the ground up for performance and flexibility.

## Key Features

- **Custom Database Engine**  
  10x faster than LiteDB, crash-resilient, no fragmentation, and optimized for disk and memory.

- **Custom Network Protocol**  
  Lightweight and efficient communication protocol for high-performance distributed systems.

- **Blazor-Based UI Framework**  
  Build reactive, component-based UIs using .NET Blazor.

- **Binary Serializer**  
  A fast, lightweight serializer tailored for structured binary data.

- **IL-Level Programming Tools**  
  Analyze, generate, and modify Intermediate Language (IL) code.

- **Advanced Data Structures**  
  Including AVL trees, low-level array interfaces, and unsafe memory operations.

## Framework Modules

Here are the main modules included in this framework:

- **Core**  
  Low-level utilities, unsafe memory helpers, and type management.

- **Collections**  
  Data structures such as custom arrays, AVL trees, and linked storage for disk.

- **Serialization**  
  High-performance binary serializer with customizable behavior.

- **Networking**  
  Lightweight protocol for sending and receiving structured data efficiently.

- **Database**  
  A custom, persistent, and fast NoSQL-style storage engine.

- **IL Tools**  
  Tools to read, analyze, and emit IL code at runtime.

- **UI Components**  
  Set of building blocks for UI in Blazor, with performance-oriented design.

- **Benchmarks & Tests**  
  Performance evaluations and automated tests to ensure stability.
